**Dyno Simulation**

The purpose of this project is to simulate different stages of a dyno
and chart them on the graph. The different results are not an actual
representation of an actual dyno.

**Getting Started**

This documentation will show the tests ran in this application. An
executable file will be issued in a new version.

Running the software
--------------------

When the application is loaded, a stock dyno will be run automatically.

**Note: Let each dyno instance run completely before running a new
dyno**
